        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup sesame oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground mustard</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>4 (6 ounce) salmon steaks</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix sesame oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame seeds, ground mustard, ginger, and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Set aside 1/2 cup of marinade for basting.</li>
            <li>Pour the rest of the marinade into a resealable plastic bag and submerge the salmon in the marinade. Squeeze as much air as you can out of the bag, seal it, and marinate the steaks for at least an hour (2 hours for better flavor). When time is up, drain and discard your used marinade.</li>
            <li>It's time to cook! Set your oven rack to about 4 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place your salmon steaks into a broiler pan and broil for 5 minutes. Brush steaks with reserved marinade, turn, and broil until your fish is opaque and flakes easily (should take about 5 more minutes). Brush one final time with marinade.</li>
        </ol>
