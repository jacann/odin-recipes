        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I have spent way way way too long working on this stupid first project trying to figure out what recipe to make so we are just going with stone soup. Enjoy.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 moderately sized rock (or a large rock, or a small rock, it does not matter at all)</li>
            <li>Some water</li>
            <li>Some carrots</li>
            <li>Some onions</li>
            <li>Some potatoes</li>
            <li>Some barley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a pot on a stove or campfire or something, I don't care just make it hot and it will work probably.</li>
            <li>Clean the stone and put it in the pot (you are gonna need a pot btw, hope it isn't too late).</li>
            <li>Cut up the potatoes and onions, then put em in the pot.</li>
            <li>Do the same thing, except (surprise) do it to the onions. Put it in the pot (with the barley while you're at it).</li>
            <li>Oh yeah put like some seasoning in, at very minimum salt and pepper but do more if you don't want to be sad.</li>
            <li>Don't forget to stir.</li>
            <li>Congrats. You have made the soup of your dreams. I am
            <em>soooo</em> happy for you.</li>
        </ol>
